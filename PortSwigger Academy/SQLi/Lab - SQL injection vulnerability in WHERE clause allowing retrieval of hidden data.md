We are exploiting a SQL injection in a web application's product category filter.
The application uses the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

This query selects all columns ( * ) from the products table in the db but only for rows that will satisfy both of the conditions:
- Category column has the value "gifts" for example. (Product belongs to a category)
- the released column has the value of 1 (indicating the product is viewable by users)

We can solve this within the web browser, changing the filter to include a SQL injection attack.

By injecting specific input into the category parameter, we can alter the query's logic to bypass the condition of `released = 1` 

This should allow us to see all of the products on the page, including unreleased ones.

To solve this lab we will use the following:
```sql
'+OR+1=1--
```

` ' ` indicates an empty string is created. The site wraps the input in single quotes and the injected ' closes the category string early.

`OR 1=1` This is always true which makes the WHERE clause evaluate to true for all rows within the products table regardless of the category or released values.

` -- ` comment that causes the rest of the query to be ignored by the database

We can put this into the category parameter within the application's URL

When entered, we can now see all of the site's products released and unreleased.
