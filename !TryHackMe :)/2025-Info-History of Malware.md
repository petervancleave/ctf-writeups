# History of Malware
(Informational TryHackMe Room Notes)

### The Creeper Program

- **1949: John von Neumann's Theory:** Proposed the concept of self-replicating computer programs, arguably the first theoretical computer virus design.
- **Von Neumann Architecture:** Describes how computers transfer data to hardware.
- **1971: The Creeper Program:**
    - Considered the first actual computer "worm" or "virus."
    - Created by Bob Thomas.
    - Utilized ARPANET to move between computers.
    - Written in PDP-10 Assembly, running on TENEX.
    - Motivation: Addressing the unreliability of computers and potential data loss by enabling program migration.
    - Functionality: Displayed the message "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" on teletype screens.
    - Technically not malware as it caused no harm.
    - Original design included deleting older copies before moving.
    - Ray Tomlinson later redesigned Creeper to copy instead of delete, which some speculated caused accidental multiple infections (though this is debated and Tomlinson stated it was limited and for debugging with permission).
    - Named after a Scooby-Doo villain.
- **ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network):**
    - Early network that predated the internet.
    - Initially focused on two protocols: remote login and file transfer.
    - The Network Working Group developed the Network Control Program, which enabled inter-computer communication within networks.
    - **Packet Switching:** A key technology used by ARPANET (and still today) where data is broken into packets, routed across the network, and reassembled by the receiver.

### Reaper

- **Creator:** Ray Tomlinson (also involved in the redesign of Creeper).
- **Purpose:** To locate and remove instances of the Creeper program.
- **Operation:**
    - Utilized the RSEXEC (Resource Sharing Executive) API, which was Bob Thomas' project for application migration across computers on ARPANET.
    - RSEXEC allowed applications to "package itself and its data up and ship itself to another RSEXEC instance on another computer which would unpack and fire up the application." 1 Â 
    - Reaper used this mechanism to move between systems, similar to Creeper, but its objective was eradication.
- **Potential Risks:** As with any software, Reaper had the potential for bugs. Tomlinson noted it was a simple program designed to track visited computers, making it theoretically capable of visiting all connected systems unless the network was disrupted.
- **Significance:** Reaper is considered the first instance of anti-virus software, designed to counteract a specific malicious (though benign) program.
- **Nomenclature:** While some sources might refer to it as a "nematode" (a type of malware that removes other malware), this term is not widely documented or commonly used in the context of Reaper.

### Wabbit
**Year:** 1974.
- **Name Origin:** Elmer Fudd's pronunciation of "rabbit," also alluding to its rapid replication.
- **Type:** One of the first self-replicating malware.
- **Impact:** Designed to quickly consume system resources, leading to slowdown and eventual system crash.
- **Operation:** Created an infinite loop that continuously spawned new processes and file copies. This rapid proliferation of CPU cycles and resource consumption caused a denial-of-service effect.
- **Classification:** Not a worm, as it did not spread across networks; it was confined to the infected machine.
- **Modern Equivalent:** Considered an early form of a "fork bomb," a type of denial-of-service attack.
- **Variants:** Versions existed for the IBM OS framework, functioning on similar principles.
- **Significance:** Notable as one of the earliest examples of malicious software focused on resource exhaustion and achieving a denial of service.

### ANIMAL

- **Year:** 1975 (PERVADE subroutine added to the original 1974 game).
- **Creator:** John Walker.
- **Functionality:**
    - Presented to the user as a benign game called "ANIMAL," a 20-questions style program that guessed an animal the user was thinking of.
    - Secretly contained a subroutine named "PERVADE."
    - PERVADE would copy both itself and the ANIMAL program into every directory the user had access to.
- **Trojan Horse Analogy:** Similar to the Trojan Horse from Greek mythology, ANIMAL appeared harmless but concealed a hidden action (replication).
- **Non-Malicious Intent:** While it spread without explicit user consent, ANIMAL was intentionally programmed to avoid damaging directory structures or files. PERVADE used file status tables to ensure safe copying.
- **Spread:** Primarily occurred across UNIVAC systems when users with shared file permissions discovered and ran the game. It also spread via the exchange of tapes between different installations.
- **Termination:** Its spread was unintentionally halted by an Operating System upgrade that altered the format of the file status tables PERVADE relied on for safe copying, preventing it from finding suitable locations.
- **Evolution:** Originally a standalone game, the self-replicating functionality was added later by the creator as an interesting feature.

### Elk Cloner

- **Year:** 1982.
- **Creator:** Richard Skrenta, a 15-year-old high school student.
- **Significance:** One of the first microcomputer viruses to spread outside a controlled environment ("in the wild").
- **Target:** Apple II operating systems.
- **Spread Mechanism:** Via infected floppy disks.
- **Activation:** Triggered on the 50th boot of a game, replacing the game with a poem about the virus.
- **Technique:** Employed a "boot sector virus" technique.
    - If a computer booted from an infected disk, the virus copied itself into the computer's memory.
    - Subsequently, any uninfected disks inserted into the infected computer would also become infected.
    - Elk Cloner wrote a signature byte to the disk's directory to mark it as infected.
- **Harm:** Caused accidental damage by overwriting reserved tracks on Apple DOS disks, classifying it as malware.
- **Boot Sector Viruses:** Infect the boot sector of a storage device (the part that starts the computer). Once infected, they attempt to infect other media inserted into the system. Less common today but still a relevant concept. Infection can occur even if the computer doesn't fully boot from the infected media (primarily applicable to floppy disks).
- **Motivation:** Initially a prank to alter friends' disks without them knowing.
- **Development:** Took Richard Skrenta approximately two weeks to write in assembly language. It eventually spread beyond his immediate circle, even reaching computers used by the US Navy.

### The Morris Internet Worm

- **Creator:** Robert Tappan Morris (1988)
- **Intended Purpose:** To highlight security vulnerabilities in academic networks.
- **Actual Outcome:** Due to a flaw in its design (failure to properly check for prior infection), the worm infected many computers multiple times, leading to a widespread denial-of-service.
- **Legal Significance:** Morris was the first person convicted of a felony under the 1986 US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
- **Spread Mechanism:** Exploited known vulnerabilities in:
    - Unix Sendmail.
    - rsh (remote shell)/rexec.
    - Weak passwords.
- **Impact:**
    - Infected approximately 2,000 computers within 15 hours.
    - Often took up to two days to remove from a single machine, rendering them unusable.
    - Estimated to have infected around 6,000 computers, roughly 10% of the internet at the time.
    - Raised global awareness about the importance of strong passwords and software vulnerabilities.
- **Berkeley r-commands:** A suite of UNIX commands (based on an early TCP/IP implementation) that allowed remote login and command execution, similar in concept to SSH (though Morris's use was illegal). The worm exploited these commands and weak passwords to gain unauthorized access.

### Cascade
- **Era:** 1980s.
- **Notable Feature:** One of the first malware to employ encryption to evade detection.
- **Target System:** Primarily Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) operating systems, exploiting the `.COM` executable file extension (similar to `.BAT` or `.sh`).
- **Evasion Tactics:**
    - **Encryption:** Used to obfuscate its code, making it harder for antivirus software to identify.
    - **Stealth:** Designed to be inconspicuous in its initial stages.
- **IBM Avoidance (Initial):** Attempted to avoid infecting IBM computers by checking for a copyright statement, but a bug caused it to infect all systems.
- **Activation:** Required the execution of the infected `.COM` file to become active. Changes to the system occurred gradually with each execution.
- **Detection:**
    - **Increased File Size:** Infected files typically grew by 1704 bytes.
    - **Host File Modification:** Altered the first three bytes of the host file, prepending them to its own main file (the exact purpose is debated).
    - **Payload Activation (Oct 1st - Dec 31st):** During this period, the virus's payload would trigger, causing text on the screen to fall to the bottom, often accompanied by noises. It could also wait for other payloads (like "Techno") to finish before activating its visual effect.
- **Variants:** Numerous variants (reportedly around 40) existed, some with mutated code, some without encryption, and some that infected specific companies without displaying the characteristic falling text. These variations often arose from the use of different assemblers while maintaining the core logic.
- **Significance:** Marked an early evolution in malware development with the introduction of encryption as a method of concealment.
